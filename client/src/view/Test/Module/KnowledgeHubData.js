    body: "Before we address the above question, let us understand what would happen if one chooses not to invest. Assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your day-to-day living; this can include expenses like housing, food, transport, shopping, medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly surplus.For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the tax effect in this discussion.\n \n \nTo drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions \nThe employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every year.\nThe cost of living is likely to go up by 8% yearly.\nYou are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50, this translates to 20 working years.\nYou dont intend to work after you retire.\nYour expenses are fixed, and you dont foresee any other expenses.\nThe balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained as hard cash.\nGoing by these assumptions, here is what the cash balance will look like in 20 years.If one were to analyze these numbers, one would soon realize this is a scary situation. A few things are quite obvious –After 20 years of hard work, you have accumulated Rs.1.7Crs.\nSince your expenses are fixed, your lifestyle has not changed over the years, and you probably even suppressed your lifelong aspirations – a better home, car, vacations, etc.\nAfter you retire, assuming the expenses will continue to grow at 8%, the retirement corpus of Rs.1.7Crs is good enough to sail you through roughly 8 years of post-retirement life. 8th year onwards, you will be in a tight spot with literally no savings left to back you up.What would you do after you run out of money in 8 years? How do you fund your life? Is there a way to ensure that you collect a more considerable sum at the end of 20 years?\nAt this point, you may think that the assumptions are simple and that real life does not work like this. I agree, and I won’t dispute that fact. However, the point to note in the above calculation is that no investments are made, hence the cash retained has a flat or zero growth.\nLet’s consider another scenario where instead of keeping the cash idle, you choose to invest the cash in an investment option that grows at, let’s say, 12% per annum. For example – in the first year, you retained Rs.240,000/- which, when invested at 12% per annum for 20 years (19 years assuming you invest at the end of 1st year), yields Rs.2,067,063/- at the end of the 20th year. For those interested in math, here is how that works –\n 240000*(1+12%)^(19)\n2067063\nDont worry about the math at this point. We will explain that later in this module (and several other modules in KnowledgeHub). Here is how the table looks if you choose to invest.",
