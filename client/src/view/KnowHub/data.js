    body: "Before we address the above question, let us understand what would happen if one chooses not to invest. Assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your day-to-day living; this can include expenses like housing, food, transport, shopping, medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly surplus.For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the tax effect in this discussion.\nTo drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions –\nThe employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every year.\nThe cost of living is likely to go up by 8% yearly.\nYou are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50, this translates to 20 working years.\nYou don’t intend to work after you retire.\nYour expenses are fixed, and you don’t foresee any other expenses.\nThe balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained as hard cash.\nGoing by these assumptions, here is what the cash balance will look like in 20 years.",
